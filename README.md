# vim-files

This is the repository of my minimalistic configurations for [Vim](http://www.vim.org/). It is highly based on the [vim-files](https://github.com/jvortmann/vim-files) by [@jvormann](https://github.com/jvortmann) (one of the greatest vimmers of my generation) but much more simplified and opinionated based on my personal preferences.

## Getting Started

After clonning the repository, run the installation script:

```
$ ./install.sh
```

You should be good to go.

## Caveats

- Clipboard integration works on recent Vim versions, like 8.0.
- The look and feel will work better with [Powerline Fonts](https://github.com/powerline/fonts).
- We use [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) as the plugin manager.

In case you are interested in exploring the details of this Vim setup take a look at the documentation of each of the plugins used. You find their Github slugs at the `vimrc` file.
